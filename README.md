# Potion Internal Project

By Luobin Wang and Kat Sullivan


This project was developed to create a more interactive and inviting lobby space at the Potion office. It combines motion tracking with mesh manipulation.

As clients, employees, etc walk by they can interact with a rotating array of photos depicting previous Potion projects.
