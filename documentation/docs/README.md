### Installation

To keep this running as a pernament installation, the following machine configurations were made:

1. Set the desktop background to something neutral. For our installation we chose a still from the assets folder.
2. Make sure the computer, the display, and the hard disks never sleep. The computer should also start automatically when the computer freezes.
