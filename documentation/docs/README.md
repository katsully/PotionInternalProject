### Installation

To keep this running as a pernament installation, the following machine configurations were made:

1. Set the desktop background to something neutral. For our installation we chose a still from the assets folder.
2. Make sure the computer, the display, and the hard disks never sleep. The computer should also start automatically when the computer freezes.
3. Add a schedule to Energy Save so that the computer starts up and shuts down at a fixed time everyday.
4. Make sure the screen saver never starts.
5. Hide all icons on your desktop. To do this, type this into the terminal
```
defaults write com.apple.finder CreateDesktop -bool false
```

6. Hide the dock by pressing Option + Command + D while in Finder.
7. Select Automatic Login when your computer starts.
8. Add your application to the Login Items of the user you log in with, to ensure your installation will start up automatically.
9. Disable Bluetooth, Universal Access, and Alert sounds. Also mute the output volume.
